    <h3 class="terms">Terms of Use</h3>
    <p class="terms">By using this application, you agree to the following conditions:<br><br>
                    - The setter of a route with that includes any content not
                    suitable for young children will be held responsible for the
                    completion of a minimum of 30 pushups.<br><br>
                    - The setter of a route deemed "poorly thought out" by at least
                    50% of the team is required to provide a sincere apology by
                    performing the top three dance moves of the seventies.<br><br>
                    - Upon viewing a ham and cheese sandwich, users of this application
                    are required to sacrifice a goat to the gods of climbing. If
                    no goats are readily available, a small child will suffice.<br><br>
                    This document is 100% legitimate, and thus, there will be consequences
                    for those that disobey the rules outlined here. Failure to adhere
                    to any of these policies will result in rapid hair loss, extreme
                    abdominal pain, and, in many cases, spontaneous combustion.
